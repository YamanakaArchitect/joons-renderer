joons-renderer written by **Joon Hyub Lee**, joonhyub.lee@kaist.ac.kr.

Use & modify as you want.  
You need Sunflow 0.07.3 and Janino to run joons-renderer from source code. I used Monkstone's version of Sunflow. These two are available on the joons-renderer git repository. You also need Processing core, gluegen-rt and jogl, which are included in Processing distributions. Add them to your build path.
