### joons-renderer brings Sunflow's ray-tracing to Processing.

### License
I wrote it for personal use, but wanted to share. Use & rewrite it as you want. When you upload whatever work you created with it on Tumblr or Flickr or any other website you use, **please tag it #joonsrenderer**, or acknowledge this library in any way. This will make me happy when I look them up, and help me keep my motivation to maintain the library :)
