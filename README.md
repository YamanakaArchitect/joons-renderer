**joons-renderer** brings Sunflow's ray-tracing to Processing.

joons-renderer written by Joon Hyub Lee (joonhyub.lee@kaist.ac.kr).
I wrote it for personal use, but thought I could share.
Use & rewrite it as you want.
When you upload whatever work you created with it,
please tag it #joonsrenderer, or acknowledge this library in any way.
This will make me happy when I look them up,
and help me keep my motivation to maintain the library :)
The official project page is: http://github.com/joonhyublee/joons-renderer.
Your contribution will be very much appreciated.
Thanks!
