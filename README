Use & modify as you want.

You need Sunflow 0.07.3 and Janino JARs to run joons-renderer from source code. I used Monkstone's flavor of Sunflow. They are available on the joons-renderer git repository. You also need Processing core, gluegen-rt and jogl JARs, which are included in Processing distributions.
